# Genre-Llama
Fine-tune decoder transformer models for movie genre classification, given titles and textual descriptions.

Similar (though not identical) code is provided for training and testing with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-2-7B. The dataset was originally published to [Kaggle by user Radmirkaz.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb) The fine-tuned output models are not included in this distribution, as they are very large.

This code was written as part of the final project for CISC 452, Neural and Genetic Computing at Queen's University, F24.
